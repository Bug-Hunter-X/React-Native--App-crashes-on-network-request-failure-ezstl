# React Native Network Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications where network request failures are not handled gracefully, leading to crashes or blank screens.  The bug is in the `bug.js` file, and the solution is in `bugSolution.js`.

## Bug Description

The application fetches data from an API.  If the API request fails (e.g., due to network issues or a server error), the application crashes or displays a blank screen instead of providing informative feedback to the user.

## Solution

The solution involves improving error handling within the `useEffect` hook's `catch` block. This ensures that the application handles failures gracefully and provides appropriate feedback to the user.
